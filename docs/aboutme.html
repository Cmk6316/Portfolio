                <p> I am currently junior studying Digital Media, Arts, and Technology at Penn State
                    Behrend. My Interest in digital media and arts began from my childhood days when
                    I would draw and paint. As the years went by, I began to expand my interests
                    into digital media. Over the years, I have created YouTube videos, Social Media
                    content, as well as taken and edited client photos. It has always been such a
                    beautiful thing to see and experience the process of creating something
                    digitally, on paper and or on canvas. </p>

        <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
        <p class="abtmeessay"> - The most significant challenge as a new learner was undertanding syntax and rules of
            writing code. 
            - I did not get to develop the other website using one of the free web
            hosting services at Penn State. I briefly attempted to do so, and found that the other
            web developing process is much easier due to it having little to do with code. 
            - The free web servives are a little basic compared to html. With html there is more that you can
            do. 
            - The challenge that was there in modifying the layout and organization of my site
            was not knowing what to look for. Sure I had W3schools, but it was still hard especially
            when I had broken code and did not know how to fix. 
            - The necessary skills to learn and
            develop these sites in either format is the undertanding of how to write code, its
            rules. 
            - As far as skills to improve on, I would say everything.
